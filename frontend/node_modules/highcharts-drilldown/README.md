# highcharts-drilldown
This is just a highcharts-drilldown module copied from highcharts v0.1.7.
This package is generated for simplicity of use.

# Installation

npm install highcharts-drilldown --save
```
# Usage
The package expects that global `Highcharts` variable is set.
It also doesn't export anything.

Then just require the package if you use common.js

require('highcharts-drilldown')
```

Or include the script in your HTML file.
```html
<script src = "node_modules/highcharts-drilldown/index.js">
```
